#  📌 Analyzing-Text-Reviews-using-Sentiment-Analysis-and-NLP-Techniques
This project analyzes text reviews using NLP and sentiment analysis techniques. It includes preprocessing (cleaning, stopwords, lemmatization), feature extraction (TF-IDF), model building ( Decision Tree, Random Forest), evaluation, and visualizations.
## 📖 Project Description  
This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to analyze text reviews and classify them into **positive, negative, or neutral** sentiments. It includes preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. Understand text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal).  
2. Apply feature extraction techniques (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings).  
3. Train multiple ML models for text classification.  
4. Evaluate model performance with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5. Visualize results with word clouds, sentiment distribution, and confusion matrices.

## 📂 Dataset  
- You can use any dataset (Kaggle, Google, or custom).  
- Example format:  
  - **review** → text review (string)  
  - **class** → sentiment label (0 = negative, 1 = positive, 2 = neutral)

## 🛠️ Tasks Covered  

### 🔹 Task 1: Data Preprocessing  
- Convert all text to lowercase.  
- Remove punctuation, numbers, and special characters.  
- Tokenize text.  
- Remove stopwords.  
- Perform stemming/lemmatization.  

### 🔹 Task 2: Feature Extraction  
- Convert text into numerical form using **TF-IDF** or **Bag-of-Words**.  
- (Optional) Try **Word2Vec/GloVe embeddings**.  

### 🔹 Task 3: Model Building  
- Split dataset into **train (80%)** and **test (20%)**.  
- Train at least two models: **Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest**.  
- Compare their performance.  

### 🔹 Task 4: Evaluation  
- Metrics: **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score**.  
- Generate and visualize **Confusion Matrix**.  

### 🔹 Task 5: Visualization  
- **Word Clouds** for positive and negative reviews.  
- **Bar Chart** showing sentiment distribution.
